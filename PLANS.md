# ExecPlan standard

Every complex phase has exactly one active plan under `plans/active/`. A plan is self-contained and must include: purpose, current environment, scope, non-goals, milestones, per-milestone acceptance criteria, validation commands, risks, decision record, actual progress, findings, next step, rollback, and update rule.

Update a plan after a milestone, failed validation, new blocker, material discovery, or approved design change. Preserve factual history; mark superseded decisions instead of silently rewriting them. Validation entries include exact command, exit code, counts, and relevant warnings.

Move a plan to `plans/completed/` only after acceptance, status/report regeneration, and local commits. Move cancelled or replaced plans to `plans/archived/` with reason and successor. Plans guide execution but do not replace `GOALS.md`, `WORKFLOW.md`, rules, contracts, or runtime state.
